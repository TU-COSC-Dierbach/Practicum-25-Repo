### BACKGROUND
This practicum involves the use of composition.<br><br>
The `ElapsedTime class` is fully implemented to 
store an elapsed time (in minutes, seconds and 
tenths of a second). <br><br>
The `Swimmer class` stores 
the best swimming event times of the butterfy, 
backstroke and free style events for a given 
swimmer.<br><br>
The `Main class` is a test driver to be
used for testing your code. 
<br>
### WHAT TO DO
- `Complete the Swimmer.java class` by filling in the
sections marked `<COMPLETE>`<br>
- `Test the program` and correct any syntax errors<br>
- `Run the predefined test runs` and correct any remaining logic errors<br>
